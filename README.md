# Sudoku-Generator-and-Calculator
This program provides the user with an interactive window providing the user with choices on how the user wants to use the program

The first choice is to generate a random Sudoku for the user to solve. The user can pick from multiple difficulties based on how challenging they want the puzzle to be.
The unsolved Sudoku will be opened in a new window, where the user will enter in numbers and the program will notify the usr whether the inputs are correct or not.
The user will also be provided with a choice to end the game and be shown the solution to the generated Sudoku.

The second choice takes the user to a new window with an empty Sudoku grid, where the user can input their own Sudoku puzzle and the program will solve the puzzle for them.
If the puzzle is invalid or unsolvable, the program will notify the user of this.
